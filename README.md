- *Week1-LoopsAndIteration* – exercises covering loops, iteration, and basic control flow  
- *Week2-Functions* – exercises demonstrating function definitions, parameters, return values, and modular coding  
- *Week3-CodeDocAndTesting* – exercises using dictionaries 
- *Week4-ErrorHandling* – exercises demonstrating file handling 
- *Week5-Recursion* – exercises using recursion for problem-solving  
- *Week6-OOPClasses* – exercises introducing object-oriented programming and classes  
- *Week7-OOPEncapsulation* – exercises demonstrating encapsulation, getters/setters, and class methods  
- *Week8-MoreComplexDataTypes* – exercises on stacks, queues, and linked nodes
